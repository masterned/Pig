# Pig

## Stages

### Stage 1
> In this stage of the project, I will be creating a website for the dice game __Pig__.
> The site will explain the rules, variations, and history of the game, provide play strategies and statistics, and explain how __Pig__ has been used in education.

## Notes to Dr Orsega

If anything pops-up, I'll add them here. Hopefully, you'll take a look at this document.

### My Rationale

#### Why do you have two README files?
> In case you don't have an obvious way of opening the main README (this one), the text "README" has instructions on how to open this file.

#### Why not just use a txt file for the README?
> I plan on uploading this repo to github for safe-keeping, and github has a built-in markdown interpreter on all of its project pages. Markdown is also much easier to read.

#### Why did you rewrite the same navigation code for each page rather than using a template engine?
> I could not guarantee you have the template engine I select, and creating a build script is beyond the current scope of this class.
> The upload limit may also prohibit build scripts.

#### I see commits from another account "masterned," and a pull request.
> That would be my personal account. I needed to work on the project while I was out of town, and I didn't have access to my school computer.
