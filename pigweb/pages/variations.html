        <h1>Variations</h1>

        <section id="two-dice">
            <h2>2-Dice Pig</h2>

            <p>
                This version is nearly identical to the original. As it's name suggests, instead of rolling a single die
                at a time, each player rolls a pair of dice. The points are calculated as normal with the added rule of
                double ones removing a player's total score.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="big-pig">
            <h2>Big Pig</h2>

            <p>
                This one is similar to the 2-Dice Rules. Players roll two dice, but doubles
                double the roll score, and double 1s do not ruin the player's total score but add 25 to their temporary
                score. There is a caveat, rolling a double forces the player to roll again.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="hog">
            <h2>Hog</h2>

            <p>
                According to other sources on the web, Hog can be played with any of the other variants' rules. The
                original scoring system is the only one that does not cause ambiguity in this version. In Hog, players
                choose the number of dice they are going to roll at the beginning of their turns. The dice can all be
                rolled at the same time.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Skunk">
            <h2>Skunk</h2>

            <p>
                Skunk has two variations itself, but both versions have the same scoring rules as 2-Dice Pig. One
                version of Skunk is played with only five rounds. A scorecard with columns for each of the letters in
                SKUNK is typically used to keep track of the scores in each round. Boxed versions of the game also
                include dice with skunk symbols replacing the 1s.
            </p>

            <p>
                The other version does not have a turn limit, but it ends after a bonus round that occurs after one of
                the players gets 100 or more points. A player wins in this variation if they have the highest score
                after the bonus round. In the bonus round, all players (except for the one that caused the bonus round)
                are given one more chance to get the highest score.
            </p>

        <section id="pass-the-pigs">
            <h2>Pass the Pigs</h2>

            <p>
                Pass the Pigs is a boxed gamed with almost identical rules to 2-Dice Pig. It uses novelty, pig-shaped
                dice with unique scoring determined by the position of the pigs after they are rolled. The game includes
                an optional rule "Hog Call" which allows players to risk some of their points for a chance to steal
                points from the player rolling. A more detailed rules document can be found <a
