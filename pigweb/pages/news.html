            <h2>Added a Roll History for Both Players</h2>

            <p>
                We are excited to announce that the game now displays all of the rolls made by each of the players. Now,
                instead of trying to guess what the computer player rolled, you can view its most recent rolls on the
                list on the right side of the window. We added the same capability to the human player's side as well!
            </p>

            <p>
                This change is as beneficial to us as it is to you. Being able to view all of the rolls made by each of
                the players will give developers of this application insight to its inner-workings. You can expect us to
                be able to squash certain bugs a lot faster after this upgrade.
            </p>
