            <h2>Basic Play</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Select who goes first: Human or Computer</li>
                <li>On player's turn, either click roll button to try a roll or hold button to collect round points</li>
                <li>On computer's turn, click its roll button</li>

            <h2>Quitting</h2>

            <p>
                In order to quit the game, you currently have three primary options. You can close the window. You can
                press <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> (<kbd>Command+X</kbd> on MacOS). Or, you can select <kbd>quit</kbd> in the
                <kbd>Game</kbd> menu at the top of the window via clicking or the associated mnemonic
                <kbd>Alt+G+X</kbd>.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Changing the Computer's Strategy</h2>

            <p>
                The computer's play style can be selected at any time during the game as long as it is not currently
                making a roll. In order to set its strategy, select the desired behavior in the <kbd>Strategies</kbd>
                menu at the top of the window. There are currently 3 different computer strategies.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Cautious - always rolls only once</li>
                <li>Random - rolls a random number of times</li>
                <li>Greedy - tries to roll 3 times every time</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Starting a New Game</h2>

            <p>
                If you have completed a game, and you would like to start a new game with the same first player, just
                press the "Start New Game" button that appears in the center of the window.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you would like to start a new game without finishing a game you have already started, go to the
                "Game" menu at the top of the screen and select "New Game". A player must already be chosen for this to
                work. Otherwise, the option will be grayed-out and will not be clickable. (The button can also be
                accessed by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+N</kbd> (<kbd>Command+N</kbd> on MacOS) or <kbd>Alt+G+N</kbd>)
