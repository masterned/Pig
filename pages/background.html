        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>Not much seems to be known about when the original game was created nor who created it. The rules of the game
            were written down for the first time in 1945 by John Scarne, an American magician, in his book <em>Scarne on
                Dice</em>. Many versions since then (as addressed in the <a href="./rules_and_variations.html">Rules
                &amp; Variations</a> page) have been released, adding their own twists to the rules.</p>

        <h2>Its Significance</h2>
        <p>Though its rules are relatively simple in comparison with other table-top games, Pig has sparked interest in
            areas even outside of entertainment. For instance, practical, academic, and moral lessons can be learned
            from the game if studied at the right angle.</p>

        <p>In academia, it is often used in middle school to teach the mechanics of probabilities in mathematics and
            statistics. In upper-level studies of computer sciences, the game is used to teach game theory and <abbr
                title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>/<abbr title="Machine Learning">ML</abbr> strategy.</p>

        <p>In practical and moral skills, it teaches about the potential loss caused by greed. The incredible about of
            randomness also serves to level the playing field, allowing anyone of any skill level to compete with nearly
            the same odds. A game such as this could be leveraged as an effective teaching tool to help young children
            learn to take turns and to know losing is not the end of the world.</p>
