        <h1>Strategies</h1>

        <h2>Notes which apply to all strategies in all versions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Due to the game relying upon randomness, playing an optimum strategy does not guarantee a win.</li>
            <li>Due to how probabilities work, rolling more dice increases the chances of losing one's turn.</li>
            <li>It is possible (not probable) to reach the goal score without ever taking a hold action.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to roll all 1s, and never score any points in a game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hold at `n`</h2>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pick a number between 2 and 100 (optimally around 20).</li>
            <li>On your turn, roll until you have increased your total score by that amount, you roll a 1, or you
                surpass 100 points.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Rational</h3>
        <p>Due to the number of sides on the dice (6), selecting 20 as the target, keeps the odds of reward versus risk
            in the favor of the player. Going for more, the player risks losing more points than they can win back
            within their odds. Going for fewer points, the player does not fully take advantage of their chances.</p>

        <h2>`t` Scoring Turns</h2>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a number of scoring turns.</li>
            <li>Break the 100 points up evenly over those turns.</li>
            <li>Use the goals as `n` in the "Hold at `n`" strategy</li>
            <li>If you roll excess, adjust next goal accordingly</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Rational</h3>
        <p>By taking your current score into account, each kept score group is better correlated with the player's
            current need.</p>

        <h2>Optimized `t` Scoring Turns</h2>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Perform "`t` Scoring Turns" strategy, including a buffer of a few points around the next goal. Increasing or
            decreasing the next goal according to buffer size and distance to the goal.</p>
        <h3>Rational</h3>
        <p>By allowing the goals to decrease or increase, each goal more dynamically fits to the player's current
            scoring state.</p>

        <h2>Score Base `b`, Keep Pace `p`, End Race `e`</h2>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Keep track of the other players score, increasing your goal whenever they pass you, decreasing your goal
            whenever you pass them. Goals must be at least the selected score base (19 should be pretty good). Keep
            rolling if either player is within a certain distance from the end (31 suggested).</p>
        <h3>Rational</h3>
        <p>Keeping track of the other player's score allows you to adapt to the situation. If the other player is
            roughly one turn away from winning, you have nothing to lose from continuous rolling.</p>

        <h2>Keep Pace `(c, d)` and End Race `e`</h2>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>If the either player is close to the goal, keep rolling.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, stay within a certain boundary of the other player.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The optimal roll strategy for this tactic is if either player's score >= 71, keep rolling. Otherwise, use the
            result of dividing the difference of your score from theirs by 8 rounded plus 21 as your round goal.</p>
        <h3>Rational</h3>
        <p>The only thing you really need to worry about is the other player. In most versions, the game only ends if
            someone reaches 100 points. Stick with them, stay ahead of them, and/or pass them at the end.</p>

                Gettysburg College came up with these numbers.</strong> Here is a link to their academic paper I pulled
            all of this information from: <a href="http://cs.gettysburg.edu/~tneller/papers/umap10.pdf">Practical Play
