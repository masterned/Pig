        <ul>
            <li>Due to the game relying upon randomness, playing an "optimum" strategy does not guarantee a win.</li>
            <li>Due to how probabilities work, rolling more dice increases the chances of losing one's turn.</li>
            <li>It is possible (not probable) to reach the goal score without ever taking a hold action.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to roll all 1s, and never score any points in a game.</li>
            <li>The strategies outlined here are optimized for the original game. Additional rules may make them less
                efficient.</li>
            <li>The game has a slight bias towards the first player to roll.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Score Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Pick a score goal for each round. If you make your goal stop. Around 20 seems to work best. Picking a
                goal that balances the risk against the reward is the key to this strategy.

        <section id="scoring-turns">
            <h2>Scoring Turns</h2>
            <p>
                Choose a number of scoring turns to have, and divide 100 by that number to get your goal for each round.
                No matter the goal, it is more common to bust on a round or overshoot it than land on it exactly. Adjust
                the goal by dividing the number of points left by the number of round remaining. This strategy allows
                the player to reduce their risk each turn by leveraging the score they have already accumulated.

        <section id="turn-buffer">
            <h2>Turn Buffer</h2>
            <p>
                Use the "Scoring Turns" strategy but factor in a score buffer. Give yourself a specific amount of leeway
                round the goal, and adjust accordingly. <em>You will need to account for the buffer when calculating
                    your next goal.</em> This allows the goals more flexibility, reducing the player's risk further.
            </p>

        <section id="competitive-goals">
            <h2>Competitive Goals</h2>
            <p>
                Keep track of the other players score, increasing your goal whenever they pass you, decreasing your goal
                whenever you pass them. Goals must be at least the selected score base (19 should be pretty good). Keep
                rolling if either player is within a certain distance from the end (31 suggested). Keeping track of the
                other player's score allows you to adapt to the situation. If the other player is roughly one turn away
                from winning, you have nothing to lose from continuous rolling.
