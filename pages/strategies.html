        <ul>
            <li>Due to the game relying upon randomness, playing an optimum strategy does not guarantee a win.</li>
            <li>Due to how probabilities work, rolling more dice increases the chances of losing one's turn.</li>
            <li>It is possible (not probable) to reach the goal score without ever taking a hold action.</li>
            <li>It is also possible to roll all 1s, and never score any points in a game.</li>
        </ul>

                        below the buffer, increase the next goal. If you take points greater than the goal, decrease the
                        next goal, staying within the buffer.</td>

                        pretty good). Keep rolling if either player is within a certain distance from the end (31
                        suggested).

                        Keeping track of the other player's score allows you to adapt to the situation. If the other
                        player is roughly one turn away from winning, you have nothing to lose from continuous rolling.
