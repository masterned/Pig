Please read README.md

If you do not have a program designed to display markdown,
please open it in any ASCII editor (Notepad will do the trick).

Because the file is in plain text and the notation is human-readable,
there should not be any obstructive artifacts in the markdown version even when viewed in a ASCII editor.
