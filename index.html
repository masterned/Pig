        <h1>Welcome to the game of Pig!</h1>

        <p>
            If you have never played the game before, Pig could be thought of as a dice version of the game Black Jack.
            Their rules have slightly different nuances, but they share a similar premise and strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is a handful of game variations, but they all have a common theme. If you would like to learn
            more details regarding how to play the original game or one of its many versions, please visit the <a
                href="./pages/rules_and_variations.html">Rules &amp; Variations</a> page.
        </p>

        <p>
            Though the game is quite simple, the randomness makes optimal play difficult.
            In the <a href="./pages/strategies.html">Strategies</a> page, some of the effective approaches are outlined.
            Along side of the strategy instructions, simple explanations are also presented to give reasoning to each
            tactic.
        </p>

        <p>
            The game Pig is also played for more than just entertainment or to waste time. Pig has been used in
            academia to teach subjects ranging from mathematics to computer sciences to statistics. You can visit the <a
                href="./pages/background.html">Background</a> page for a more in-depth look at the history and utility
            of Pig.
